* A question I'd like to learn the answer to by analyzing data would be how US elections would change if we switched to a popular or ranked voting system, instead of using the electoral college
* Six months after graduation, I want to be starting a job or working on a Master's degree in a city I've never lived in before. Five years later, I'd love to be doing economics work in the government or in the Federal Reserve system
* Persoanlly, my biggest career accomplishment would be to be happy in my job and feel like I can see the impacts of what I'm doing in the world around me in some way
* In this course, I'm hoping to get positive exposure to the worlds of data analysis, coding, and statistics, and to see if it's something I'd want to learn more about in the future
* A fun fact about myself is that I once pet Obama's dog while he was President
